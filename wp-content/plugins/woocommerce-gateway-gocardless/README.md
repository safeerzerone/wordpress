## Overview

This is a feature plugin for accepting payments via [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/). It requires [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) to be installed before the WooCommerce GoCardless Gateway can be activated.

## Compatibility

This extension is compatible with:

- [Woo Subscriptions](https://woo.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)

## Setup

### Test account setup

You can create a user on [gocardless.com](https://gocardless.com) for live transactions and [on the sandbox](https://manage-sandbox.gocardless.com/) for test transactions. When you first set up a site, you’ll be prompted to create a user for the correct GoCardless environment when setting up the webhooks.
