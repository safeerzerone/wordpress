Extends WooCommerce with a GoCardless gateway. A GoCardless merchant account is required.

== Description ==

This is a feature plugin for accepting payments via [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/).  It requires [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) to be installed before the WooCommerce GoCardless Gateway can be activated.

= Compatibility =

This extension is compatible with:

- [Woo Subscriptions](https://woo.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)

= Test Account Setup =

You can create a user on [gocardless.com](https://gocardless.com) for live transactions and [on the sandbox](https://manage-sandbox.gocardless.com/) for test transactions. When you first set up a site, you’ll be prompted to create a user for the correct GoCardless environment when setting up the webhooks.

= Development =

**Install Dependencies & Build**

The plugin uses Webpack to build the assets. To build the assets, follow these steps:

- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm run build:webpack` to build the asset files. You can also run `npm run start:webpack` to watch the files and rebuild them automatically when they change.

You can find the source files in the `assets` and `client` directories.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does GoCardless support BACS? =

Yes, the GoCardless extension supports BACS and the payment methods mentioned in the [GoCardless API documentation](https://developer.gocardless.com/api-reference/#overview-supported-direct-debit-schemes).

= I’m based in country x – can I use GoCardless on my site? =

While GoCardless can collect from customers from many countries, note that GoCardless can only on-board merchants from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States, and Canada.

= Do I need to fill in the webhook secret? =

Yes, you need to manually fill in the webhook secret and configure the webhook endpoint. It cannot be automated, so we made it as painless as possible.

= Why are my orders not redirecting to the thank you page or marked as paid? =

If you use a security or firewall plugin or have a firewall application on your server, be sure that you allow requests from GoCardless in that plugin’s settings. GoCardless sends webhooks from the following IP addresses which you may wish to add to your firewall’s approved list:

- 35.204.73.47
- 35.204.191.250
- 35.204.214.181

= Everything is set up and customers are ordering using this gateway, so why am I not receiving payouts from GoCardless? =

Ensure that you’re verified by GoCardless, as no payouts are made until this is done. Keep an eye out for emails from GoCardless, and check your Spam folder, as you are also notified when funds are waiting.

= Does GoCardless support tokenization? =

Yes. Customers may opt to securely store payment information for future checkout.

= Can I use GoCardless with pre-orders? =

GoCardless includes support for [WooCommerce Pre-Orders](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-pre-orders/) (separate purchase).

= Can I use GoCardless with subscriptions? =

Yes, it’s possible to use GoCardless to accept automatic, recurring payments for [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) (separate purchase).

= Do I need to Create an App? =

Merchants need only click the Connect button to hook up their GoCardless account. It’s not necessary to Create an App.

Create an App is for developers seeking to code their own applications from scratch and not use the GoCardless for WooCommerce extension or any other already made.

= Does this work with Pro and Plus packages? =

Yes. As of version 2.4.5, WooCommerce GoCardless includes support for merchants upgrading to Pro and/or Plus. It:

- Notifies via webhook with event “mandate_replaced” with the new mandate in the payload.
- Gives an error response about mandate replacement when payment is created with the old mandate.

= How is it decided which payment method gets selected between Instant Bank Pay, Direct Debit, or a combination of both? =

The selection is automated and depends on two things: first, whether Instant Bank payments are supported for both the customer and the merchant, and second, the items being purchased. For example, **Instant Bank Pay** will be used for simple product purchases where the customer’s billing address is in the UK (GBP), Germany (EURO), and France (EURO). Similarly, for the same setup, subscription product purchases will be completed using the **Instant Bank Payment** and **Direct Debit (mandate)** setup flow. For countries and currencies where instant payment is not supported, the Direct **Debit (mandate)** only flow will be used.

= Why does the GoCardless gateway classify all transactions as "recurrent"? =

GoCardless collects payments by setting up a **Direct Debit (Mandate)**. This Direct Debit mandate can be used to collect future payments. Even for a simple product, GoCardless sets up a Direct Debit and collects the payment under the mandate. As a result, every payment—whether for a one-time purchase or a subscription—is processed via this Direct Debit (Mandate), which is recurrent. Therefore, transactions appear as recurrent.

It is important to note that for merchants and customers in the UK (GBP), Germany (EUR), and France (EUR), GoCardless supports **Instant Bank Pay (IBP)**. IBP allows for one-off payments that are collected instantly without setting up a Direct Debit, and these transactions are not marked as recurrent.

= How can I connect a single GoCardless account to multiple WooCommerce stores using this plugin? =

The GoCardless plugin uses the OAuth flow to connect with your GoCardless account. With OAuth, only the most recently connected access token remains active. This means if you use the "Connect with GoCardless" button on multiple stores, the connection for the most recently connected store will remain active, while connections for previously connected stores will be disabled.

To connect a single GoCardless account to multiple stores, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Access Token:** Log in to your GoCardless Dashboard and create an access token. Follow the instructions here: [How to create an access token](https://hub.gocardless.com/s/article/How-to-create-an-access-token?language=en_GB).

2. **Set the Access Token in WordPress:** Open your wp-config.php file and define the `WC_GOCARDLESS_ACCESS_TOKEN` constant. Set the created access token as its value.

```
define('WC_GOCARDLESS_ACCESS_TOKEN', 'your-access-token-here');
```

3. **Add the Code Snippet:** Add the code snippet below to your theme's functions.php file or to a site-specific plugin:

```
add_filter( 'option_woocommerce_gocardless_settings', function ( $settings ) {
	if ( ! is_array( $settings ) ) {
		return $settings;
	}

	// Set custom access token. "WC_GOCARDLESS_ACCESS_TOKEN" should be defined in wp-config.php.
	if ( defined( 'WC_GOCARDLESS_ACCESS_TOKEN' ) && WC_GOCARDLESS_ACCESS_TOKEN ) {
		$settings['access_token'] = WC_GOCARDLESS_ACCESS_TOKEN;
		$settings['testmode']     = 'no'; // Set to 'yes' for sandbox mode.
	}

	return $settings;
} );
```

Following these steps will allow you to connect a single GoCardless account to multiple WooCommerce stores.

= Does the plugin use any external services? =

Yes, it uses [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/) ([privacy policy](https://gocardless.com/privacy/)) to accept payments and [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) ([privacy policy](https://automattic.com/privacy/)) to connect GoCardless accounts to individual WooCommerce stores.
